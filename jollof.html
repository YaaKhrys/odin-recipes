    <h2>The Steps To Prepare The Dish</h2>
    <h3>The Main Dish - Jollof Rice</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat vegetable oil or palm oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add finely chopped onions and minced garlic. Saut√© until onions become translucent.</li>
            <li>Add tomato paste or blended tomatoes to the pot. Stir well and cook for a few minutes until the raw flavor of the tomatoes dissipates.</li>
            <li>Add spices such as curry powder, thyme, paprika, ginger, nutmeg, bay leaves, allspice, rosemary, and cloves. Mix well to combine the flavors.</li>
            <li>Rinse the rice thoroughly under cold water, then add it to the pot. Stir until the rice is evenly coated with the tomato mixture.</li>
            <li>Pour in chicken or vegetable broth, and add coconut milk to the pot. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Stir gently to combine all the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid and simmer over low heat for about 20-25 minutes, or until the rice is cooked and tender, and the liquid is absorbed. Avoid stirring the rice too often to prevent it from becoming sticky.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>The Fried Chicken</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>If marinating the chicken, mix hot sauce, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Add the chicken pieces and coat them well. Let them marinate for at least 30 minutes, or preferably overnight in the refrigerator.</li>
            <li>Heat vegetable oil in a deep frying pan or skillet over medium heat.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, mix flour, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, black pepper, and dried herbs together.</li>
            <li>Take each marinated chicken piece and coat it in the seasoned flour mixture, ensuring it is fully coated.</li>
            <li>Carefully place the coated chicken pieces into the hot oil and fry them until golden brown and crispy on both sides. This usually takes about 6-8 minutes per side, depending on the size of the chicken pieces. Cook in batches if needed.</li>
            <li>Once cooked, remove the chicken from the oil and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>The Fried Plantain</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Peel the ripe plantains and cut them into diagonal slices, about 1/2-inch thick.</li>
            <li>Heat vegetable oil in a frying pan over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Carefully add the plantain slices to the hot oil and fry them until golden brown and caramelized on both sides. This usually takes about 3-4 minutes per side.</li>
        </ol>
    
    <p>Arrange the jollof rice, fried chicken, and fried plantains on a serving platter or individual plates. Serve them together as a delicious and complete meal. <br> <br>
