            <li>1 pound (450 grams) ground beef or ground Italian sausage</li>
            <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 can (14 ounces/400 grams) crushed tomatoes</li>

            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt (adjust to taste)</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper (adjust to taste)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Cheese Mixture</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
            <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon dried basil</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Layering</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>asagna noodles (approximately 9-12 sheets, depending on the size of your baking dish)</li>
            <li> Additional grated Parmesan cheese for sprinkling on top</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>The Steps To Prepare The Dish</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to the temperature recommended on the lasagna noodle package (usually around 375°F or 190°C).</li>
        <li>Start by preparing the meat sauce. In a large skillet or saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, and cook until they become translucent and fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the ground beef or Italian sausage to the pan and cook until it browns and is no longer pink. Break up the meat into small pieces as it cooks.</li>
        <li>Once the meat is cooked, drain any excess fat from the pan. Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, and tomato sauce to the skillet. Stir in the dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and pepper. Simmer the sauce over low heat for about 15-20 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.</li>
        <li>While the sauce is simmering, prepare the cheese mixture. In a bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, grated Parmesan cheese, shredded mozzarella cheese, chopped parsley, beaten egg, dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper. Mix everything together until well combined.</li>
        <li>Now it's time to assemble the lasagna. Start with a thin layer of meat sauce at the bottom of a greased baking dish. Place lasagna noodles on top of the sauce, slightly overlapping them. Spread a layer of the cheese mixture evenly over the noodles. Repeat these layers until you run out of ingredients, ending with a layer of meat sauce on top.</li>
        <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes. Then, remove the foil and continue baking for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the top layer is bubbly and golden.</li>
        <li>Once the lasagna is cooked, remove it from the oven and let it rest for about 10 minutes before serving. This allows the lasagna to set and makes it easier to slice.</li>
        <li>Serve the lasagna warm, and you can sprinkle some grated Parmesan cheese on top if desired.</li>
    </ol>
    Enjoy your homemade lasagna!
